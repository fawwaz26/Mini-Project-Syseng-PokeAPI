# Mini Project for System Engineer Class - PokeAPI

This project is developed as part of the Mini Project for the System Engineer class. It aims to provide practical experience with a variety of technologies and tools relevant in the field of system engineering and software development.

## Topics Covered

The project encompasses a wide range of topics and technologies including:

- **Python - Flask**: Used for backend development, creating RESTful APIs that serve data.
- **ReactJS**: Employed for the frontend development to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **SQL**: Utilized for database management, ensuring data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated efficiently.
- **Docker**: Containers are used to package the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different development and deployment environments.
- **Monitoring Tools and Logging (NewRelic)**: NewRelic is integrated for monitoring application performance and logging, offering insights into the application's operational aspects.
- **CI/CD in Github**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment processes are implemented using GitHub Actions, ensuring automated testing and deployment.
- **Kubernetes with GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)**: Kubernetes is used for orchestrating the containerized applications, managing deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.
- **API Integration**: The project integrates with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) to fetch data about Pok√©mon for various functionalities within the application.
- **And other knowledge**: Includes other essential knowledge areas such as security best practices, API rate limiting, and efficient resource management.
